Matlab codes for the paper  Top-k Feature Selection Framework Using Robust 0-1 Integer Programming

Decsription: This code is partially  modified from Esan's SSC code. % Copyright @ Ehsan Elhamifar, 2012. Parially modified from chun-guang li's code for Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering: A unified optimization framework. 

Try two demo files "Demo_for_Semisupervised.m" and "Demo_for_Unsupervised.m"  for semi-supervised FS and unsupervised FS, respectively.

If you use the codes for semi-supervised or unsupervised feature selection research, please cite the following work.
