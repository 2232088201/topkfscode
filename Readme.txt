Decsription: This code is partially  modified from Esan's SSC code. % Copyright @ Ehsan Elhamifar, 2012
Parially modied from chun-guang li's code for <Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering: A unified optimization framework>. 


There are two demo files, one is used for demonstrate the result of semi-supervised feature selection and the other one is used for demonstration the result of unsupervised feature selection. 

If you use the codes for feature selection, please cite the following work.
